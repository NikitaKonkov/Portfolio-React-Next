      I'm deeply fascinated by the universe and its wonders, from the smallest subatomic
      particles to the vast cosmic structures. My interest in science has led me to explore
      what makes up our universe and our place within it. This scientific curiosity influences
      my approach to problem-solving and fuels my passion for understanding complex systems.

      When I'm not working, you can find me developing games, creating hashing algorithms,
      designing encryption systems, or working on compression algorithms. I'm also an enthusiast
      of retro computing, particularly enjoying working with old game consoles and writing code
      in various programming languages to push their capabilities beyond their original design.
      I'm fascinated by the mathematical challenges behind these technologies and enjoy exploring the
      theoretical aspects of computer science through practical projects.
